## 10/3/2025 - Got the idea of this project  

I got the idea of this project and because I'm just bored all day and only would play Valorant i thought it's a good idea but I'm not really aiming for one of the prizes, they're cool but I don't really need em, maybe some more are coming soon. There is one tiny little problem: I don't know how to create an whole operating system for esp32 with display so ig Copilot gotta cook a bit. I alr got an esp with display @ home but only the back buttons, ig i'ma have to use the touchscreen (meh). Hope i can learn some more stuff bout apis, esps and networking, i alr did sum kind of research so i have an raw idea on how to do it...![logo.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e5dc6d2b1390754d862844b582402bc64d5b1a49/logo.jpg)
